with you
It's blues, the new, and the skew.

to meet in Monterey
Bay of hues, the deep, another muse.

to San Francisco 
Circle the squares, ride in a robot, unscathed.

to stroll Redlands 
Citrus shaded, history dated, where I chopped down a tree.

I would love to show you the Salton Sea
It's really something to see, I would imagine
With you

Oh, to see it all again
with you.

I would love to share California 
with you.</div>
