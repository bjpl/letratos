## Style Guidelines

### Poetry
- Keep formatting minimal and let the words speak
- Use markdown line breaks (two spaces at end of line) for intentional breaks within stanzas
- Use blank lines to separate stanzas

### Photography
- Use descriptive but concise alt text
- Include location with pin emoji (üìç) in captions
- Keep image file sizes reasonable for web (ideally under 2MB)
