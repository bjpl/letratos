This is an example photography collection. You can add your images to the `/assets/images/` folder and reference them in the front matter using the `images` array. Each image can have:

- `url`: Path to the image file
- `caption`: Text displayed below the image
- `alt`: Alternative text for accessibility

The gallery will display images in a clean, minimalist style consistent with the rest of the site.
